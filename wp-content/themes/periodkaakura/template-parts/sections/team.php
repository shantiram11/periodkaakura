            <p>
              Priyanka Budhathoki is a development communication professional
              for over ten years. Priyanka began her journalism career through
              radio and has produced dozens of radio talk shows and magazines.
              Years of friendship and sisterhood with Shristi resulted in
              bringing out the silenced voice about menstruation creating space
              for all menstruators to speak up against all taboos and stigma
              raising voice for dignified menstruation.
