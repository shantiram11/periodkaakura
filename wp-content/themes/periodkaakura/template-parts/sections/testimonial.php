            <p>People fighting against period taboos and the stigma they faced inspire us the most. There are changemakers in the society becoming the voice of the voiceless that encourages us to keep moving forward with creating awareness on menstrual health. We envision a society where no girls, women and non-binary people face discrimination during period. For that, we aim to continue producing more podcast episodes in the coming days raising awareness on menstrual health and hygiene. </p>
